# EigenStake: Ethereum AVS Restaking Platform

## Overview

EigenStake is a platform that helps Ethereum holders optimize their staking and restaking strategies by analyzing various Actively Validated Services (AVS) protocols. The application uses AI-powered analysis to match user preferences with the most suitable AVS opportunities.

## Features

### Restaking Strategy Analysis
- **AI-Powered Strategy Assessment**: Input your investment preferences and risk tolerance, and our AI engine will analyze your strategy.
- **Personalized Opportunity Matching**: Based on your strategy, the platform identifies AVS protocols that align with your goals.
- **Risk-Reward Analysis**: Each opportunity is scored and analyzed for risk factors, security measures, and potential yield.

### Protocol Integration
- **Multiple AVS Options**: Integration with top AVS protocols like EigenLayer, Obol Network, and SSV Network.
- **Real-Time Protocol Data**: Pulls live data from DeFi Llama to ensure you have the most current yield and TVL information.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key metrics including APY, security scores, slashing risk, and node counts.

### Yield Optimization
- **Smart Rebalancing**: Automatic suggestions for rebalancing your stake to maximize yield.
- **Gas-Aware Decisions**: Considers transaction costs when recommending portfolio adjustments.
- **Strategy Execution**: Implements your chosen strategy across selected protocols.

### Wallet Integration
- **Position Analysis**: View and analyze your current Ethereum positions.
- **Transaction Verification**: Secure transaction verification through EigenLayer.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT models for strategy analysis
- **Data Sources**: DeFi Llama API for real-time protocol metrics
- **Blockchain Integration**: P2P restaking protocol to fulfill restakes.

## Getting Started


1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the application

## Environment Setup

The application requires several environment variables to function properly:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For strategy analysis
- `ETH_RPC_URL`: For blockchain interactions
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: For signing transactions (in production, use a secure key management solution)

## Production Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Start Command: `npm run start`
- Port: 5000

## Security Considerations

- User funds are never directly controlled by the platform
- All strategies are advisory in nature
- Transaction signing happens locally in the user's wallet
- OpenAI integration is used for analysis only, not for transaction execution
